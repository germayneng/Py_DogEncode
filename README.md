# ML-Treats

ML-treats consists of various utility for machine learning.

Long time back, DogEncode started out as a R project to help with encoding categorical variables. 
This new project aims to port not only some of these codes over to **python** but also other useful utility functions that i used for data science competitions / projects. 


# W.I.P 

1) Various categorical encoding which i have used personally over a myriad of kaggle competitions 
2) Easy parallel of functions 
3) aws wrapper to load any object onto s3
3) Other misc utility functions i have picked up over time
